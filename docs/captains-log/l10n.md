Localization  (L10n)
====================

The DIP API offers the class `L10n` for localization (backed by `ResourceBundle`s that rely on ordinary Java property files) which is available to the main application, as well as to all bundles active in the OSGi framework. In the latter case the bundle might even augment the host translations by its own set of resource bundles, where the local `ResourceBundle` is searched first, to fall back on the host's one in case of a missing key.


Call from anywhere using the default localizatin bundle:

```java
L10n.getInstance().getString(key)
```

Augment with local localization bundle, using the default one as fallback:

```java
 L10n l10n = L10n.newInstance("locales/localization", this.class.getClassLoader());
 l10n.getString(key)
```

...where `locales` is a resource directory of the extra bundle that includes property files like `localization_en.properties` (or the global `localization.properties` file).
