					Technical notes for developers. Have a look here before you change

					what not.

						<dd>
							<p>
								<em>Cobertura</em> didn't play nice with Java 8 (as of Oct.
								2015, cobertura-maven-plugin, v. 2.7), hence <em>Jacoco</em>
								is used to produce test coverage reports instead. <br />

								<em>Jacoco</em> is nice too, and seems to recieve more love
								from maintainers anyways nowadays. So there's that.</p>

							<p>The execution phases had to be tweaked in order to not
								produce the site folder too early, otherwise no other reports
								would be generated (there might be some kind of aggregate/merge
								button, alas I didn't find it...). <br />
								Similarly do not try to change the <em>Jacoco</em> files
								(i.e. the Maven properties <tt>testing.surefire.file</tt> and
								<tt>testing.failsafe.file</tt>), or the reporting will fail.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt>Running single unit or integration tests</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The latest version of the <em>Maven Surefire Plugin</em>
								(maven-surefire-plugin, v. 2.19) has a bug s.t. single tests
								can't be run from the IDE/NetBeans (still works fine from the
								console though). That's not much fun, so version 2.18.1 is
								used in the meantime.</p>
