# English localization

# Usually there is no punctuation (dots, colons, ...) except for:
#  - button-labels that open a file-/directory chooser (three dots), 
#  - status-labels indicating (indefinite) action, or
#  - messages/complete phrases.
#
# Words start with an uppercase even if needed all lowercase. Use 
# toLowerCase() if needed.
#
# Singular and plural words are explicitly labeled. Terms usable
# in both cases should use the .any suffix  (e.g. image (singular),
# images (plural), and image.any).
#
# Format tokens: {0}, {1}, ..., {n-1}
#
# Finally, note that the keywords are alphabetically ordered (to make
# sure we not use any of them twice), with an additional comment 
# thrown in here and there to mark certain blocks...
