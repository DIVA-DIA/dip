	<description>
		DIVA DIP Third Party is a multi-module (or aggregate) for third party
		libraries to be directly copied, or repackaged as OSGi bundles.

		<module>pom-osgi-repackage</module>

		<!-- copy OSGi bundles. These dependencies are already OSGi bundles and
		just can be copied to a bundle directory (`app.core.bundledir` by
		default). -->

		<!-- technically neither a copy, nor a repackage; but a (host) bundle.
		Yet we're just wrapping some third party fonts to use as glyphs, so
		here we are...
		Note that we don't deploy them as OSGi bundles directly, but load them
		as dependency in the APP, where we publish them to the OSGi framework,
		s.t. the APP and all bundles/plugins can use these glyphs (just like we
		do with the API).

		Thus for new glyph modules we need to:

			1) adjust `pom-super` to define the version,
			2) adjust the POM of the APP to include it as a dependency,
			3) similary adjust `pom-osgi-bundle` to include it as dep., and
			4) make sure to use the `ch.unifr.diva.dip.glyphs` namespace for the
			   class, since that's where APP will be looking for glyph classes
			   by means of reflection (in order to publish them to the OSGi
			   framework).

		<!-- repackage as OSGi bundles. These dependencies are not OSGi bundles
		yet, so we have to create and add the OSGi bundle manifest file and
		repackage the dependency as a new jar file, before copying them over to
		a bundle directory (`app.plugin.bundledir` by default). -->
