/**
 * Bundle for basic/fundamental JavaFX image processing plugins. Currently this
 * bundle just includes adapters from AWT {@code BufferedImage} to JavaFX
 * {@code Image} and back.
 *
 * <p>
 * Considering that there are currently no plans to implement processors that
 * directly operate on JavaFX {@code Image}s instead of AWT
 * {@code BufferedImage}s (offering both options doesn't really buy us
 * anyhing...), this bundle (currently) isn't actually needed/doesn't serve much
 * purpose.
